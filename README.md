This is an experiment testing out the BESH stack, namely:

- Bun
- Elysia
- Supabase
- HTMX

For developer experience, following will be used:
- Vercel for hosting
- linear.app for project management

This is inspired by trying to figure out the easiest and most productive way for a 1-man team to build an app for production.
Similar to what Ruby on Rails or Phoenix LiveView provides.
Ultimately, we want to waste as litte amount of time as possible.
For example, spending more money for scaling the product is vastly easier than putting multiple engineering hours to craft your own solution.
When building a product, you should actually get revenue from it. So spending extra money to save time means you can invest it somewhere else, resulting in even more growth!
This stack also requires little fine tuning, because all the components are blazing fast. Thus, vertical scaling will be more than enough before ever having to modify the architecture.
